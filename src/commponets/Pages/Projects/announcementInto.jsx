              About This Project
            </h2>
            <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg">
              For a school assignment, I created a custom 3D animated intro using After Effects to introduce the 
              Friday announcements. The project involved hundreds of layers, lighting, and syncing animation to music.
              It ended up being number one, even though we had primarily learned Premiere Pro and not After Effects.
              I wanted to try something more advanced.

              <li>
                <strong>Concept Development:</strong> I started by looking for inspiration and stumbled across the 3D realm.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Modeling & Animation:</strong> Using After Effects and the school's logos, I created many layers for the 3D effect with 3D camera movement.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Lighting & Effects:</strong> The lighting was a beam ray, and the 3D camera movement was done with a 3D camera layer. The 3D logo effect involved shifting the X, Y, and Z axes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Music Syncing:</strong> I added a music track, getting the music/SFX from a copyright-free platform.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Final Rendering:</strong> After finalizing the animation, I rendered the project. As we went around rating the best animations, I received. ðŸ¥‡
